This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.



When working with Prisma and you define a schema, add the connection string, and run commands like `npx prisma init`, `prisma db push`, etc., here's what happens at each step:

### **1. Define Schema in Prisma**
- **Schema Definition**: You create a `schema.prisma` file where you define the database models, their fields, types, and relationships.
- **Configuration**: The `datasource` block specifies the connection to the database using the connection string, and the `generator` block defines the settings for generating the Prisma Client.

### **2. Adding the Connection String**
- **Database Connection**: The connection string in the `datasource` block is how Prisma knows where your database is and how to connect to it (e.g., credentials, host, port, database name, etc.).

### **3. Running `npx prisma init`**
- **Initialization**: This sets up the Prisma project by creating:
  - `schema.prisma` file if it doesn’t already exist.
  - A default structure for Prisma setup in your project (e.g., `prisma/` directory).

### **4. Running `prisma db push`**
This command is used to synchronize your Prisma schema with the database without generating migration files. Here's what happens:

#### **Steps in Detail**
1. **Schema Parsing and Validation**:
   - Prisma reads the `schema.prisma` file.
   - It validates the syntax and checks for errors.

2. **Database Connection**:
   - Prisma connects to the database using the connection string in the `datasource` block.

3. **Database Schema Update**:
   - Prisma compares the `schema.prisma` file with the current state of the database.
   - If the database is empty or has mismatches, Prisma creates or updates tables, columns, relationships, and indexes to match the `schema.prisma` file.
   - Existing data is preserved unless there’s a destructive change (e.g., a column deletion).

4. **Feedback to User**:
   - Prisma logs what changes were applied to the database.
   - If everything aligns, it outputs a success message.

### **What Happens Behind the Scenes**
- **Introspection**: If you have existing tables, Prisma may introspect to ensure schema alignment.
- **No Migration Files**: Unlike `prisma migrate`, `db push` does not generate migration files but directly applies changes to the database schema.

### **Outcome**
- The database schema is now aligned with your `schema.prisma` file.
- You can now use the Prisma Client to interact with the updated database.

---

### Optional Commands Afterward
- **`npx prisma generate`**: Generates the Prisma Client based on the updated schema.
- **`npx prisma studio`**: Opens Prisma Studio, allowing you to visually interact with the data in your database. 

### Key Differences Between `prisma db push` and Migrations
- `prisma db push` directly syncs the schema with the database without creating migration files (ideal for prototyping).
- `prisma migrate` uses migration files for changes, enabling version control and rollback.

Creating a reusable Prisma Client in a `lib` folder and using a pattern like the one you've shared is a common practice in Node.js applications. Here's why:

### **1. Singleton Pattern for Prisma Client**
Prisma Client connects to the database, and every time you create a new `PrismaClient` instance, it establishes a new database connection. This can lead to:
- **Excessive Connections**: If you create multiple instances in different parts of your application (e.g., in each API handler), you may end up exhausting the database connection pool.
- **Resource Overhead**: Each instance consumes memory and resources.

By using a **singleton pattern**, you ensure that only one instance of `PrismaClient` is created and reused across your application.

---

### **2. Avoid Issues with Hot Reloading in Development**
In development, frameworks like Next.js and tools like Nodemon often "hot reload" the server when you make changes. Without the proper handling:
- **Duplicate Instances**: Each reload can create a new `PrismaClient` instance, leaving the previous ones open and causing memory leaks or connection pool exhaustion.
  
To handle this, the global variable (`global.prisma`) is used:
- In **development**, the `global` object ensures that the same Prisma Client instance persists across hot reloads.
- In **production**, where hot reload doesn't occur, a new instance is safely created.

---

### **3. Example Code Explanation**
```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

declare global {
    var prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;
}

const prisma = global.prisma || new PrismaClient();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') global.prisma = prisma;

export default prisma;
```

#### **Step-by-Step Explanation**
1. **Global Declaration**:
   ```typescript
   declare global {
       var prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;
   }
   ```
   This allows TypeScript to recognize `global.prisma` as a property on the `global` object.

2. **Create or Reuse PrismaClient**:
   ```typescript
   const prisma = global.prisma || new PrismaClient();
   ```
   - If `global.prisma` already exists (from a previous reload), it reuses that instance.
   - Otherwise, it creates a new `PrismaClient`.

3. **Assign to Global in Development**:
   ```typescript
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') global.prisma = prisma;
   ```
   - In development, the new instance is assigned to `global.prisma` to ensure persistence during hot reloads.
   - In production, this step is skipped to avoid unintended global side effects.

4. **Export for Reuse**:
   ```typescript
   export default prisma;
   ```
   - The Prisma Client instance is exported so it can be used anywhere in the application.

---

### **4. Benefits of This Approach**
- **Consistency**: Ensures a single Prisma Client instance is used throughout the app.
- **Performance**: Prevents multiple database connections and reduces connection pool exhaustion.
- **Compatibility**: Handles hot reload issues in development environments gracefully.
- **Scalability**: In production, it adheres to best practices by not polluting the `global` object.

---

### **When to Use This Pattern**
This pattern is especially useful in:
- **Serverless Environments**: Avoids issues with multiple function executions creating multiple `PrismaClient` instances.
- **Next.js Applications**: Prevents hot reload issues during development.
- **Scalable Projects**: Ensures efficient resource utilization and easier debugging. 


Let’s dive deeper into the **benefits of using slugs** in a web application like one built with Next.js. I'll break it down with more **real-world examples** and use cases:

---

### **1. SEO Benefits (Search Engine Optimization)**

**Why it's beneficial**: 
- URLs with meaningful words (slugs) are ranked higher by search engines because they indicate the content of the page.
- Example: 
  - URL with slug: `example.com/blog/nextjs-slug-usage`
  - URL with ID: `example.com/blog/12345`

Search engines like Google prioritize descriptive URLs because they help users understand the content before even clicking the link.

**User perspective**: Imagine searching "Next.js slug usage" on Google. A URL like `example.com/blog/nextjs-slug-usage` makes it clear what the page is about, increasing the likelihood that you'll click on it.

---

### **2. User-Friendly URLs**

**Why it's beneficial**:
- Slugs make URLs **easier to read, share, and remember**.
- Example:
  - Without slug: `example.com/product/45678`
  - With slug: `example.com/product/iphone-15-pro`

**Use case**:
- If you're sharing the product link over chat or in a presentation, a descriptive slug looks professional and gives immediate context.

---

### **3. Unique Identification Without Exposing Internal Details**

**Why it's beneficial**:
- Using slugs hides sensitive implementation details, such as database IDs, from the public.
- Example:
  - Without slug: `example.com/user/12345`
  - With slug: `example.com/user/john-doe`

**Use case**:
- Exposing database IDs might make your application vulnerable to enumeration attacks, where someone tries sequential IDs (`/user/12346`, `/user/12347`) to access unauthorized data.

---

### **4. Consistency Across Systems**

**Why it's beneficial**:
- Slugs provide a consistent identifier for content that can be used across the database, URLs, and frontend.
- Example: A blog post with the slug `nextjs-slug-usage` can:
  - Be used as the unique key in your database.
  - Generate the URL for the blog.
  - Be referenced in API responses.

**Use case**:
- If you rename or restructure content, the slug remains the same, ensuring consistent links.

---

### **5. Improved Analytics and Tracking**

**Why it's beneficial**:
- Tracking user activity is easier and more meaningful when URLs contain slugs.
- Example:
  - Instead of seeing `example.com/blog/12345` in your analytics, you see `example.com/blog/nextjs-slug-usage`.

**Use case**:
- Marketers and product managers can quickly identify which pages are performing well.

---

### **6. Localization and Multilingual URLs**

**Why it's beneficial**:
- Slugs can be translated for different languages to improve accessibility and SEO in global markets.
- Example:
  - English: `example.com/blog/nextjs-slug-usage`
  - French: `example.com/blog/utilisation-des-slugs-nextjs`

**Use case**:
- If you're building a multilingual website, slugs help users in different regions understand the content.

---

### **7. Dynamic Content Rendering**

**Why it's beneficial**:
- Slugs enable the same dynamic route to render different pages based on the slug.
- Example:
  - URL: `example.com/blog/nextjs-slug-usage` → Displays content for "Next.js Slug Usage."
  - URL: `example.com/blog/react-dynamic-routing` → Displays content for "React Dynamic Routing."

**Use case**:
- In e-commerce, dynamic slugs for products or categories make your application more modular and scalable.

---

### **8. Better Backward Compatibility**
If you update a blog title or product name, the slug can remain the same, ensuring old URLs still work.

**Example**:
- A blog titled "Using Slugs in Next.js" with slug `nextjs-slug-usage` is published.
- Later, you change the title to "Mastering Slugs in Next.js," but the URL remains `example.com/blog/nextjs-slug-usage`.

This ensures:
1. Users with old links don’t encounter broken pages.
2. SEO rankings are preserved.

---

### **When Slugs Aren't Used**
Without slugs, URLs can look like random, meaningless strings or IDs (`example.com/post/12345`). While functional, they:
- Aren't descriptive.
- Offer no SEO value.
- Make tracking and sharing difficult.

---

**In summary**, slugs aren't just about dynamic routing. They are a cornerstone of user-friendly, scalable, and SEO-optimized web applications.

React Query is a powerful library for managing server state in React applications. It simplifies the process of fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server-side data, enabling developers to focus on building features instead of handling boilerplate code for API requests.

---

### **Core Features**

1. **Data Fetching and Caching**:
   - React Query fetches data from an API and automatically caches it. Cached data is reused for subsequent queries, improving performance.
   
2. **Automatic Refetching**:
   - Data is kept fresh by automatically refetching stale data or when network status changes.

3. **Query Invalidation**:
   - Invalidate queries to refetch and update data when something changes (e.g., after a mutation).

4. **Optimistic Updates**:
   - Update the UI before the server confirms a change for a smoother user experience.

5. **Background Refetching**:
   - Refetch data in the background to keep the app updated without interrupting the user experience.

6. **DevTools**:
   - Provides a dedicated DevTools extension for debugging queries and mutations.

---

### **When to Use React Query**

- When your application fetches data from a server.
- For caching server responses to improve performance.
- When you need fine-grained control over data synchronization and invalidation.

---

### **Installation**

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @tanstack/react-query
```

---

### **Getting Started Example**

#### **Setting Up a Query Client**

First, wrap your application with the `QueryClientProvider` to provide the query client to your React components:

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <MyComponent />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

---

#### **Basic Data Fetching**

```tsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

function MyComponent() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(['todos'], fetchTodos);

  async function fetchTodos() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/todos');
    return response.json();
  }

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

---

### **Mutations**

Mutations are used for creating, updating, or deleting data.

```tsx
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

function AddTodo() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  const mutation = useMutation(newTodo => fetch('/api/todos', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(newTodo),
  }), {
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['todos']); // Refetch the todos query
    },
  });

  const handleAdd = () => {
    mutation.mutate({ title: 'New Todo' });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleAdd}>Add Todo</button>;
}
```

---

### **Key Benefits**

1. **Improved Performance**:
   - Cached responses reduce unnecessary API calls.

2. **Simpler State Management**:
   - Eliminates the need for manual state management for server data.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms for failed requests.

4. **Reactivity**:
   - Updates UI automatically when data changes or becomes stale.

5. **Offline Support**:
   - Automatically retries requests when the network is restored.

---

### **Advanced Features**

1. **Pagination and Infinite Queries**:
   - Manage paginated or infinite scroll data with `useInfiniteQuery`.

2. **Prefetching**:
   - Prefetch data to ensure it's available before rendering a component.

3. **Hydration**:
   - Server-side rendering (SSR) support with `react-query`.

---

### **DevTools**

Install React Query DevTools for debugging:

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

Add it to your app:

```tsx
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-query-devtools';

<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
  <MyComponent />
  <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} />
</QueryClientProvider>
```

---

### **Why Use React Query?**

1. **Avoid Boilerplate**: Simplifies fetching and managing data without Redux or custom state logic.
2. **Built-in Caching**: Handles caching out of the box.
3. **Automatic Freshness**: Keeps data fresh with minimal configuration.
4. **Error Management**: Centralized and streamlined error handling.
5. **Great Community**: Supported by an active community and constantly updated.

React Query is an excellent tool for modern React applications where data fetching is a significant concern!

The React Query `QueryClient` is the core mechanism for managing server-side state. Under the hood, it acts as a centralized controller that coordinates data fetching, caching, invalidation, and synchronization. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

---

### **Core Components of QueryClient**

1. **Query Cache**:
   - The `QueryCache` stores all queries and their associated data, metadata, and state.
   - Queries are uniquely identified by a **query key**, ensuring consistency across fetches.

2. **Mutation Cache**:
   - Similar to the query cache but specifically handles mutations.
   - Tracks mutation states, manages retries, and applies optimistic updates.

3. **Observers**:
   - Observers are created for each component that subscribes to a query or mutation.
   - They ensure that each component receives updates when the query state changes (e.g., loading, error, or success).

4. **Event System**:
   - QueryClient uses an event-driven architecture.
   - Events such as "query added," "query updated," or "mutation completed" are dispatched to handle state transitions.

5. **Schedulers**:
   - React Query includes schedulers for background refetching, retries, and garbage collection.
   - Ensures smooth operations without blocking the main thread.

---

### **Key Processes**

#### 1. **Query Execution**
   - When you call `useQuery`, the following happens:
     - A unique `queryKey` is used to check the `QueryCache`.
     - If data is already cached and fresh, it's returned immediately.
     - If the data is stale or not found, a fetch request is initiated.
     - Once the data is fetched, the `QueryCache` updates its state, and subscribed components are re-rendered.

#### 2. **Caching**
   - Queries are cached with metadata like timestamps, stale status, and associated observers.
   - Cached data is used for subsequent queries, reducing network requests.

#### 3. **Invalidation**
   - When a mutation updates the data, related queries are invalidated.
   - Invalidated queries trigger refetching to keep the cache synchronized with the server.

#### 4. **Staleness and Garbage Collection**
   - Queries have a "stale time" after which they are considered outdated.
   - Unused queries are eventually removed from memory based on a configurable garbage collection policy (`cacheTime`).

#### 5. **Retries and Error Handling**
   - QueryClient retries failed requests based on a retry policy (e.g., exponential backoff).
   - It provides hooks for custom error handling (`onError`).

---

### **Under-the-Hood Workflow**

#### Example with `useQuery`:

```tsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

function Todos() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery(['todos'], fetchTodos);

  async function fetchTodos() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/todos');
    return response.json();
  }

  if (isLoading) return 'Loading...';
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

**How It Works**:
1. **Initialization**:
   - A `QueryObserver` is created for the query with the key `['todos']`.
   - It checks the `QueryCache` for existing data.
   
2. **Cache Check**:
   - If the data exists and is fresh, the cached value is returned immediately.
   - If the data is stale or missing, it triggers a fetch.

3. **Fetching**:
   - The `fetchTodos` function runs, fetching data from the server.
   - React Query tracks the query's lifecycle (e.g., loading, success, or error).

4. **Updating the Cache**:
   - Once the fetch is successful, the `QueryCache` is updated with the new data and metadata.

5. **Component Re-render**:
   - React Query notifies the `QueryObserver` about the updated state.
   - The component re-renders with the new data.

---

### **QueryClient API**

You can interact with the `QueryClient` programmatically to perform advanced operations:

#### Example: Manual Cache Invalidation
```tsx
import { useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

function InvalidateButton() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  const handleClick = () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries(['todos']); // Invalidate the cache for 'todos'
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Refresh Todos</button>;
}
```

#### Example: Prefetching Data
```tsx
queryClient.prefetchQuery(['todos'], fetchTodos);
```
- Prefetches data so it’s available in the cache before a component renders.

#### Example: Direct Cache Manipulation
```tsx
queryClient.setQueryData(['todos'], [{ id: 1, title: 'New Todo' }]);
```
- Updates the cache directly without making a fetch request.

---

### **Advantages of QueryClient**

1. **Centralized Control**:
   - All queries and mutations are managed in one place.
2. **Efficiency**:
   - Minimizes network requests through caching and deduplication.
3. **Reactivity**:
   - Automatically updates components when server-side data changes.
4. **Extensibility**:
   - Customizable fetch policies, retry strategies, and stale data handling.

React Query's QueryClient is a well-engineered state management system for server data that abstracts away most of the complexities while giving you full control when needed.

### Optimistic UI: An Overview

**Optimistic UI** is a technique in user interface development where changes are immediately reflected in the UI before the server confirms the operation. This approach improves user experience by making the app feel faster and more responsive.

---

### **How It Works**
1. **Initial State Update**:
   - When a user performs an action (e.g., liking a post, adding an item to a cart), the UI updates immediately as if the operation succeeded.
   
2. **Backend Call**:
   - The app sends a request to the server to perform the operation in the background.

3. **Server Response**:
   - If the server confirms success, no further UI changes are needed.
   - If the server fails (e.g., network issue, validation error), the app rolls back the UI to the previous state and may show an error message.

---

### **Example Use Case**
#### **1. Liking a Post**
- **Without Optimistic UI**:
  - The app sends a "like" request to the server.
  - The "like" count only updates after the server responds successfully.
- **With Optimistic UI**:
  - The "like" count updates immediately.
  - If the server response fails, the "like" is reverted.

---

### **Code Example in React**

Here’s how you might implement Optimistic UI for liking a post:

#### **Frontend (React Example)**

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function LikeButton({ postId, initialLikes }) {
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(initialLikes);
  const [hasLiked, setHasLiked] = useState(false);

  const handleLike = async () => {
    if (hasLiked) return; // Prevent multiple likes

    // Optimistically update the UI
    setLikes((prev) => prev + 1);
    setHasLiked(true);

    try {
      // Send the like request to the server
      await fetch(`/api/posts/${postId}/like`, { method: 'POST' });
    } catch (error) {
      // Rollback if the request fails
      setLikes((prev) => prev - 1);
      setHasLiked(false);
      console.error("Failed to like the post:", error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleLike} disabled={hasLiked}>
      👍 Like ({likes})
    </button>
  );
}
```

---

#### **Backend Example (API Endpoint)**
```javascript
// Express.js example
app.post('/api/posts/:id/like', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const postId = req.params.id;
    // Simulate a server operation, e.g., updating the database
    await Post.findByIdAndUpdate(postId, { $inc: { likes: 1 } });
    res.status(200).send({ success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send({ error: 'Failed to like the post' });
  }
});
```

---

### **Key Benefits**
1. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Actions feel instant, reducing perceived lag.
2. **Seamless Interactions**:
   - Users don’t need to wait for the server to respond.
3. **Engagement**:
   - Faster feedback keeps users engaged.

---

### **Potential Challenges**
1. **Data Consistency**:
   - If the server fails, the UI must rollback accurately.
2. **Error Handling**:
   - Clearly inform users when something goes wrong.
3. **Complex Scenarios**:
   - Optimistic updates in collaborative or real-time systems may need careful synchronization with the server.

---

### **Best Practices**
1. **Handle Failures Gracefully**:
   - Always implement rollback logic for server errors.
2. **Validate Input**:
   - Ensure that optimistic updates align with server-side constraints.
3. **Use Libraries**:
   - Tools like **React Query** or **Apollo Client** offer built-in support for optimistic updates.

---

### **Using React Query for Optimistic UI**

React Query simplifies optimistic updates with `mutate`:

```tsx
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from 'react-query';

function LikeButton({ postId }) {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  const mutation = useMutation(
    async () => {
      // Perform the server call
      await fetch(`/api/posts/${postId}/like`, { method: 'POST' });
    },
    {
      // Optimistic update
      onMutate: () => {
        queryClient.setQueryData(['post', postId], (oldData) => ({
          ...oldData,
          likes: oldData.likes + 1,
        }));
      },
      // Rollback if error
      onError: () => {
        queryClient.invalidateQueries(['post', postId]);
      },
    }
  );

  return <button onClick={() => mutation.mutate()}>👍 Like</button>;
}
```

---

### **When to Use Optimistic UI**
- Actions with **low failure rates** (e.g., likes, follows).
- **Single-user operations** (not heavily collaborative).
- Apps where **fast feedback** is critical to user experience.

In **React Query**, `mutate` is a method provided by the `useMutation` hook that allows you to perform mutations (i.e., operations that modify data, like creating, updating, or deleting records). It offers advanced features like optimistic updates, error handling, and cache invalidation.

---

### **Key Concepts of `mutate`**

#### 1. **Triggering a Mutation**
- The `mutate` method is used to trigger the mutation logic, such as sending a POST, PUT, or DELETE request to your server.
- It takes an optional argument (data or variables) that can be passed to the mutation function.

#### 2. **Optimistic Updates**
- `mutate` supports immediate UI updates (optimistic updates) while waiting for the server response.
- If the server request fails, it can rollback changes and show an error message.

#### 3. **Automatic Cache Management**
- React Query allows you to update or invalidate specific cache entries based on the mutation result.

---

### **`useMutation` Hook Structure**

The `useMutation` hook accepts two main arguments:

1. **Mutation Function**:
   - This is the function that performs the mutation (e.g., an API call).

2. **Options Object**:
   - Provides callbacks for handling mutation lifecycle events:
     - `onMutate`: For optimistic updates.
     - `onSuccess`: Runs after a successful mutation.
     - `onError`: Handles errors and rollbacks.
     - `onSettled`: Runs after mutation is complete, regardless of success or failure.

---

### **Basic Example**

#### Backend API
Imagine an API endpoint that likes a post:
```javascript
POST /api/posts/:id/like
```

#### Frontend Code

```tsx
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from 'react-query';

function LikeButton({ postId }) {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  // Mutation function: sends the like request
  const likePost = async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/posts/${postId}/like`, { method: 'POST' });
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to like the post');
  };

  // Use Mutation
  const { mutate, isLoading, isError } = useMutation(likePost, {
    // Optimistic update
    onMutate: async () => {
      // Cancel any outgoing queries for this post
      await queryClient.cancelQueries(['post', postId]);

      // Snapshot the previous value
      const previousData = queryClient.getQueryData(['post', postId]);

      // Optimistically update the cache
      queryClient.setQueryData(['post', postId], (oldData) => ({
        ...oldData,
        likes: oldData.likes + 1,
      }));

      // Return the rollback data in case of error
      return { previousData };
    },
    // Rollback on error
    onError: (err, variables, context) => {
      // Restore the previous data
      queryClient.setQueryData(['post', postId], context.previousData);
    },
    // Invalidate cache on success
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['post', postId]);
    },
    // Always run after mutation (success or error)
    onSettled: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['post', postId]);
    },
  });

  return (
    <button onClick={() => mutate()} disabled={isLoading}>
      {isLoading ? 'Liking...' : 'Like'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

---

### **How This Works**

1. **Optimistic Update (`onMutate`)**:
   - Before the mutation request is sent, the cache is updated to reflect the optimistic state (e.g., increment the like count).
   - A snapshot of the previous cache state is saved for rollback in case of an error.

2. **Handle Errors (`onError`)**:
   - If the mutation fails, the rollback logic restores the previous state using the saved snapshot.

3. **Post-Mutation Actions**:
   - On success (`onSuccess`), the cache is invalidated or updated to ensure it reflects the server state.
   - On settle (`onSettled`), clean-up tasks like invalidating queries are handled.

---

### **Advanced Example with Variables**

You can pass variables to `mutate` for dynamic operations.

```tsx
function AddCommentButton() {
  const mutation = useMutation(
    async (newComment) => {
      const response = await fetch('/api/comments', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(newComment),
      });
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to add comment');
    }
  );

  const handleAddComment = () => {
    mutation.mutate({ postId: 123, text: 'Great post!' });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleAddComment}>Add Comment</button>;
}
```

In this example:
- The argument passed to `mutate` (`{ postId: 123, text: 'Great post!'}`) is available in the mutation function.

---

### **Benefits of Using `mutate` in React Query**
1. **Optimistic Updates**:
   - Provides seamless and responsive UI interactions.
2. **Error Handling**:
   - Built-in support for rollback and notifications.
3. **Cache Management**:
   - Automatic and manual cache invalidation/updating.
4. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - Control mutation flow with `onMutate`, `onError`, `onSuccess`, and `onSettled`.

---

### **When to Use React Query’s `mutate`**
- Any operation that modifies server-side data (e.g., create, update, delete).
- Scenarios requiring optimistic updates (e.g., like buttons, form submissions).
- Apps where consistent and synchronized state between the client and server is critical.

- ### **Prefetching in Next.js**

**Prefetching** in Next.js is a technique to load data or resources for a page before the user navigates to it. This helps improve performance and user experience by ensuring that the content is ready when the user clicks a link or triggers navigation.

---

### **How Prefetching Works in Next.js**

1. **Automatic Prefetching**:
   - Next.js automatically prefetches pages linked with the `<Link>` component.
   - When a link enters the viewport, Next.js downloads the JavaScript and other necessary assets for the linked page.

   Example:
   ```tsx
   import Link from 'next/link';

   export default function Home() {
     return (
       <div>
         <Link href="/about">Go to About</Link>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
   - When the above `Link` component is rendered, Next.js will prefetch `/about`.

2. **Manual Prefetching**:
   - Use the `prefetch` method on a `next/link` component or dynamically load data via APIs for specific use cases.
   - Example with manual prefetching:
     ```tsx
     import Link from 'next/link';

     export default function Home() {
       return (
         <div>
           <Link href="/about" prefetch={false}>Go to About</Link>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

3. **Data Prefetching**:
   - For dynamic data, you can use **Server Side Rendering (SSR)**, **Static Site Generation (SSG)**, or **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** to prefetch and hydrate data before rendering.

---

### **Benefits of Prefetching**
1. **Improved Performance**:
   - Faster page transitions as assets are loaded in advance.
2. **Better User Experience**:
   - Reduces the perceived latency during navigation.
3. **SEO-Friendly**:
   - Prefetching static data helps ensure pages are fully loaded for search engine crawlers.

---

### **Hydration Boundary in Next.js**

#### **What is Hydration?**
In Next.js (and other React frameworks), **hydration** refers to the process where the server-rendered HTML is transformed into a fully interactive React application on the client side. 

- The server sends static HTML to the browser.
- Once React loads, it "hydrates" the HTML by attaching event listeners and converting it into a dynamic React app.

#### **Hydration Boundary**
A **hydration boundary** defines a specific section of your application where React resumes control and attaches event handlers.

---

### **Why Do We Need Hydration Boundaries?**

1. **Improved Performance**:
   - Large pages with a lot of content can take time to hydrate entirely. Using hydration boundaries allows you to hydrate smaller, critical parts of the page first.

2. **Better User Experience**:
   - Users can interact with parts of the page sooner, even while other parts are still being hydrated.

3. **Concurrent Rendering**:
   - In React 18 (used by Next.js), hydration boundaries enable partial hydration, where different parts of the page are hydrated independently and concurrently.

4. **Error Isolation**:
   - Errors during hydration in one part of the app won't affect other sections.

---

### **How to Define Hydration Boundaries**

In Next.js, hydration boundaries can be implemented using **React Server Components (RSCs)** or dynamic imports:

#### **1. React Server Components**
Next.js allows you to use server components, which only render on the server and don't require hydration. Use these for static, non-interactive content.

```tsx
// app/components/StaticContent.server.js
export default function StaticContent() {
  return <div>This is static server-rendered content.</div>;
}
```

#### **2. Dynamic Imports with `ssr: false`**
You can dynamically import components and prevent them from being server-rendered or hydrated unnecessarily.

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const NoSSRComponent = dynamic(() => import('./NoSSRComponent'), { ssr: false });

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <NoSSRComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### **Use Cases for Hydration Boundaries**
1. **Static Pages with Interactive Widgets**:
   - Hydrate only the interactive parts, such as a carousel or modal.

2. **Large Data-Intensive Pages**:
   - Break the page into smaller boundaries to hydrate critical content first.

3. **Error-Handling in Hydration**:
   - Isolate components to prevent a hydration failure from breaking the entire app.

---

### **Summary**

- **Prefetching** in Next.js helps load page assets and data before navigation for faster transitions.
- **Hydration boundaries** allow partial and isolated hydration to improve performance, user experience, and error resilience. These are essential for optimizing large or complex applications, especially with React 18's concurrent rendering.

The behavior of console logging on the **server** instead of the **client** happens because of the following reasons in Next.js:

### 1. **Next.js Differentiates Server and Client Components**
   - **Server Components**: Run on the server during rendering.
   - **Client Components**: Run on the client (browser).

By default, all components in the `app` directory are **server components** unless explicitly marked with `"use client"`. This means:
- If a component is async (like your `Page` component) and is not marked with `"use client"`, it is treated as a **server component**.
- The code inside it, including `console.log`, executes on the server.

---

### 2. **Server Actions are Inherently Server-Side**
   - The `onBoardUser` function is a **server action** (indicated by the `use server` directive or its placement in a server-side module).
   - When you use `onBoardUser` in a server component, it ensures that the function execution and any `console.log` happen **on the server** because server actions cannot run client-side.

This behavior enforces that server-side logic stays server-side. Even if the `Page` component were marked as a client component (`"use client"`), trying to call a server action like `onBoardUser` would result in an error.

---

### 3. **Async Components Default to Server Context**
   - The `Page` component in your example is an **async function**:
     ```tsx
     const Page = async () => {
       console.log("dashboard page");
       const user = await onBoardUser();
       return <div>Ye</div>;
     };
     ```
   - Async components in Next.js inherently run on the **server** because:
     - Fetching data (`onBoardUser`) typically happens server-side.
     - Async operations align with Next.js's server rendering process.

Thus, the presence of `async` signals that the component operates in a **server context**, and all its code, including `console.log`, runs on the server.

---

### 4. **How Next.js Decides Where to Run a Component**
   - **Server Components**: Rendered on the server.
     - `console.log` outputs appear in the server logs.
     - Data fetching and server actions work seamlessly.
   - **Client Components** (marked with `"use client"`): Rendered on the browser.
     - `console.log` outputs appear in the browser's developer console.
     - Server actions (`onBoardUser`) cannot be used.

In your case:
- Since `Page` is not explicitly marked as `"use client"`, Next.js treats it as a **server component**.
- Using `onBoardUser`, which is a server action, further confirms the server context.
- Thus, all `console.log` statements in `Page` execute on the server.

---

### **Example Breakdown**
#### Case 1: Without `"use client"`
```tsx
import { onBoardUser } from "@/actions/user";

const Page = async () => {
  console.log("dashboard page"); // Logs to the server console.
  const user = await onBoardUser(); // Server-side data fetching.
  return <div>Welcome, {user?.name || "Guest"}!</div>;
};

export default Page;
```
- Treated as a **server component**.
- `console.log` and `onBoardUser` both execute on the server.

#### Case 2: With `"use client"`
```tsx
"use client";

const Page = async () => {
  console.log("dashboard page"); // Logs to the browser console.
  // Cannot use `onBoardUser` because it's a server action.
  return <div>Welcome!</div>;
};

export default Page;
```
- Treated as a **client component**.
- `console.log` outputs to the browser console.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Async components** in the `app` directory are treated as **server components** by default.
- Using a **server action** like `onBoardUser` guarantees server-side execution.
- `console.log` location depends on the component type:
  - Server component: Logs appear in the server logs.
  - Client component: Logs appear in the browser console.

Yes, you're absolutely correct!

### Key Difference Between `include` and `select`:
1. **`select`**:  
   - Focuses on the fields from the **current model/table**.
   - Allows you to specify which fields to return **from the same table**.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   select: {
     firstname: true,
     lastname: true,
   }
   ```
   This returns only the `firstname` and `lastname` from the `User` model.

2. **`include`**:  
   - Focuses on related models or tables (i.e., foreign key relationships).
   - Allows you to include data from **related tables/models**.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   include: {
     subscription: true,
   }
   ```
   This includes the `subscription` object, which is a related model linked to the `User` model.

---

### Example for Clarification:
Assume the following Prisma schema:
```prisma
model User {
  id           String         @id @default(uuid())
  firstname    String
  lastname     String
  email        String
  subscription Subscription?
}

model Subscription {
  id       String @id @default(uuid())
  plan     String
  userId   String
  User     User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

#### Using `select`
Query:
```javascript
await client.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: "user123" },
  select: {
    firstname: true,
    lastname: true,
  },
});
```

Result:
```json
{
  "firstname": "John",
  "lastname": "Doe"
}
```
- This only returns fields from the `User` model.

---

#### Using `include`
Query:
```javascript
await client.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: "user123" },
  include: {
    subscription: true,
  },
});
```

Result:
```json
{
  "id": "user123",
  "firstname": "John",
  "lastname": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "subscription": {
    "id": "sub123",
    "plan": "FREE",
    "userId": "user123"
  }
}
```
- This includes the related `subscription` object as well.

---

### Combined Example:
If you want to fetch specific fields from the `User` model and include related data from the `Subscription` model:
```javascript
await client.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: "user123" },
  select: {
    firstname: true,
    subscription: {
      select: {
        plan: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Result:
```json
{
  "firstname": "John",
  "subscription": {
    "plan": "FREE"
  }
}
``` 

This approach allows precise control over what is returned from both the current table (`User`) and related tables (`Subscription`).

Exactly! Here's a detailed breakdown of the flow and behavior:

---

### **How Optimistic UI Works in Your Case**

1. **Immediate UI Update (Optimistic UI)**
   - When you call the `mutate` function with certain variables (e.g., `name`, `id`, etc.), the optimistic UI logic immediately updates the UI **before the server responds**.
   - This update uses the `variables` passed to the `mutate` function and doesn't depend on the actual server response yet.

   ```tsx
   mutate({
     name: "Something",
     id: mutationId,
     createdAt: new Date(),
     keywords: ["something"],
   });
   ```
   - These variables (`name`, `id`, etc.) are added to the UI using `optimisticUiData`.

---

2. **Actual Data from the Server**
   - After the mutation completes:
     - The backend processes the request and updates the data source (e.g., a database).
     - The frontend refetches the updated data using mechanisms like `invalidateQueries` or other query synchronization methods.

   ```typescript
   onSettled: async () => {
     return await client.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: [queryKey] });
   },
   ```

   - **Outcome**: The optimistic data is replaced with the actual data from the server, ensuring consistency.

---

3. **What Happens Without Optimistic UI**
   - If you **didn't** implement optimistic UI, the UI would stay unchanged until:
     1. The server processes the mutation.
     2. The updated data is fetched and applied to the UI.

   This would create a delay, leading to a less responsive user experience.

---

4. **Who Sets the Final Data?**
   - The final, authoritative data is set by:
     - **Default Query Data**: The initial data loaded via the query (e.g., `useQueryAutomations`).
     - **Backend Response**: When `invalidateQueries` refetches the data after a mutation.

   The optimistic data is only temporary and gets replaced once the actual data is fetched.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Optimistic Data**:
  - Temporary and based on the `mutate` function's variables.
  - Provides instant feedback for a smoother user experience.
  
- **Actual Data**:
  - Comes from the server and is authoritative.
  - Replaces optimistic data after the mutation completes and data is refetched.

- **UI Consistency**:
  - Optimistic updates ensure responsiveness but rely on the server's response to confirm or adjust the UI.

---

### Example Scenario

1. **User Clicks "Create"**:
   - Calls `mutate` with optimistic variables: `{ name: "Something", id: mutationId, ... }`.
   - UI instantly shows this new entry.

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - Backend creates the automation and returns actual data (e.g., `{ id: 123, name: "Something", createdAt: "..." }`).

3. **Query Refetching**:
   - `invalidateQueries` fetches the actual data.
   - UI updates to reflect the backend state, replacing the optimistic entry if needed.

If any issue occurs during this flow (e.g., the backend fails), the UI can handle it gracefully by removing the optimistic update.


You're absolutely right about the general flow of Redux and Redux Toolkit: 

1. **Store** contains all the reducers (state logic).
2. **Slices** define actions and reducers, which are combined into the store.
3. **Actions** are used to dispatch changes, while reducers determine how the state changes in response to those actions.

Now let’s go step by step to explain how you **use them** in your application:

---

### **1. Set Up the Redux Store in Your Application**
First, you need to wrap your app with the `Provider` from `react-redux` so the Redux store is accessible throughout your application.

#### Example:
```javascript
"use client";
import { store } from "./store"; // Import your store
import { Provider } from "react-redux"; // Import Provider

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      {children}
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

### **2. Using State and Dispatch in Components**
Redux state and actions can be accessed using hooks like `useSelector` and `useDispatch` provided by `react-redux`.

---

#### **Accessing State (`useSelector`)**
To read data from the Redux store:
```javascript
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const trigger = useSelector((state) => state.AutomationReducer.trigger);
  
  return <div>Current Trigger Type: {trigger.type}</div>;
};
```

#### **Dispatching Actions (`useDispatch`)**
To trigger an action that updates the Redux store:
```javascript
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { AUTOMATION } from "./slices/automation";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const handleUpdateTrigger = () => {
    dispatch(AUTOMATION.actions.TRIGGER({ trigger: { type: "COMMENT" } }));
  };

  return <button onClick={handleUpdateTrigger}>Update Trigger</button>;
};
```

---

### **3. How It All Works Together**
1. **State Access:**
   - `useSelector` pulls the specific piece of state you want from the store (e.g., `state.AutomationReducer.trigger`).

2. **Dispatch Actions:**
   - `useDispatch` sends an action to the store (e.g., `AUTOMATION.actions.TRIGGER`).
   - The action gets handled by the reducer in the slice (e.g., the `TRIGGER` reducer in `AutomationSlice`).

3. **Reducer Updates State:**
   - The reducer modifies the state based on the action payload.
   - The updated state is made available to components through `useSelector`.

---

### **Putting It All Together**
Here’s an end-to-end example:

#### **Slice (automation.ts)**
```javascript
import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

type TriggerState = {
  trigger?: { type?: string; keyword?: string };
};

const initialState: TriggerState = {
  trigger: { type: undefined, keyword: undefined },
};

const AutomationSlice = createSlice({
  name: "automation",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    TRIGGER: (state, action: PayloadAction<{ trigger: { type: string } }>) => {
      state.trigger = action.payload.trigger;
    },
  },
});

export const AUTOMATION = AutomationSlice;
export default AutomationSlice.reducer; // Export reducer
```

#### **Store (store.ts)**
```javascript
import { configureStore, combineReducers } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import AutomationReducer from "./slices/automation";

const rootReducers = combineReducers({
  AutomationReducer,
});

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducers,
});
```

#### **React Component**
```javascript
"use client";
import React from "react";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { AUTOMATION } from "@/slices/automation";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const trigger = useSelector((state) => state.AutomationReducer.trigger);

  const handleUpdateTrigger = () => {
    dispatch(AUTOMATION.actions.TRIGGER({ trigger: { type: "COMMENT" } }));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Trigger Type: {trigger?.type || "None"}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleUpdateTrigger}>Set Trigger to COMMENT</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **FAQs**

#### Q1: **How do I debug Redux state changes?**
Use Redux DevTools. Redux Toolkit comes with DevTools enabled by default, so you can inspect actions, state changes, and more in your browser.

#### Q2: **How do I manage asynchronous actions (e.g., API calls)?**
Use `redux-thunk` (included in Redux Toolkit by default) or `createAsyncThunk` for managing async logic in slices. Let me know if you need a detailed example for `createAsyncThunk`!
